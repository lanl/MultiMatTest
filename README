Multi-Material test code: Full and sparse data structures

This code is a set of multi-material test kernels used on a random and geometric multi-material mesh to test the performance of different full and sparse data structures. It supports the paper "A Comparative Study of Multi-material Data Structures for Computational Physics Applications", Technical Report LA-UR-16-23889, Version 2

To run the code, first untar the volfrac.dat.tgz file

   tar -xzvf volfrac.dat.tgz

Build
   Rename one of the CMakeFiles* files to CMakeFiles.txt. One is the default, another turns off vectorization, and another includes more vectorization using AVX-512 instructions.

   cmake .

And run

   ./MultiMatTest
